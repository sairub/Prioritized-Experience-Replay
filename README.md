Experience replay is a technique that helps online reinforcement learning agents use their memory to remember experiences from the past and enhance their decision-making process from this memory. In this project, uniform experience replay is applied using a deep Q-network, in which transitions are uniformly sampled from the agentsâ€™ replay memory. In the latter part, proportional prioritization is applied to replay the transitions that are categorized as more important, at a higher frequency. Prioritization gives a more robust and effective learning system.
